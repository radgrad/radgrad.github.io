First, there are many online sites providing information about internships, including: LinkedIn.com, Glassdoor.com, Internships.com, InternMatch.com, YouTern.com, Idealist.org, CoolWorks.com, Indeed.com, ZipRecruiter.com, SimplyHired.com, Careershift.com, USAJobs.gov, Experience.com, Handshake.com, StudentOpportunityCenter.com, and of course the NSF REU Site Directory.  Each of these vary in their filtering, search, and recommendation mechanisms. In addition to these online repositories, but just as important, there can be many high quality internships with local small businesses who simply contact the University directly.

The occurrence of either false positives or false negatives can provide insight into the capability of the system.  (2) Does InternBit change the behavior of students with respect to their degree experience? This is the more fundamental goal: by decreasing the ``friction'' for finding internships of interest, do students learn about requirements earlier in their degree program, and plan to acquire the necessary skills as part of their degree experience?"))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
